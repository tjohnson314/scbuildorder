Starcraft II build order developer/optimiser.  Inspired by <a href='http://code.google.com/p/evolutionchamber/'>Evolution Chamber</a> by Lomilar, designed in C++ using memory pools and other techniques to improve efficiency.

Note that this requires the Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Redistributables x86: http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?familyid=A7B7A05E-6DE6-4D3A-A423-37BF0912DB84&displaylang=en

You will need the x86 version even if you're using a 64 bit operating system.

This application has been tested on Windows XP, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, and in Wine running on Linux.

**Note**: The code is no longer hosted on GoogleCode.  It is now available on GitHub: https://github.com/Carbon-12/SCFusion.  Issues will be tracked there from now on.


I would love to accept donations through PayPal, however PayPal Australia has decided that a donate button can only be used by a registered charity and hence they have restricted my account.  I do have a personal account so if you're really keen to help out then you can email me at CarbonTwelve.Developer@gmail.com and I'll give you the details.

Donations will go towards improving the project in the best way I can, including developer tools, hardware, helping offset time invested, and hopefully towards future developments such as building a website to host found build orders.
